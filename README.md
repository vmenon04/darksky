- **Visibility Scoring**: Algorithm combining Bortle scale ratings with lunar conditions
- **Optimal Timing**: Recommendations based on astronomical twilight and moon position

### Bortle Scale Integration
Each location is rated on the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale (1-9):
- **1-2**: Pristine to excellent dark skies
- **3-4**: Good to moderate light pollution
- **5-6**: Bright suburban to urban skies
- **7-9**: Inner city to extreme light pollution

3. **Check Schedule**: View optimal viewing dates with moon phase information
4. **Plan Your Trip**: Use the visibility scores and conditions to plan your stargazing adventure

## üåô How It Works

### Dark Sky Zone Selection
The application includes a curated database of International Dark-Sky Association certified locations, including:
- Death Valley National Park (Bortle Class 1)
- Joshua Tree National Park (Bortle Class 2)
- Big Bend National Park (Bortle Class 1)
- Mauna Kea Observatory (Bortle Class 1)
- And many more...

### Visibility Scoring
The app calculates visibility scores (1-10) based on:
- **Moon illumination**: Less moonlight = better deep sky viewing
- **Bortle classification**: Lower light pollution = higher score
- **Seasonal considerations**: Optimal viewing windows

### Astronomical Calculations
- **Moon phases**: Precise lunar phase calculations
- **Illumination percentages**: How much of the moon is lit
- **Optimal timing**: Best hours for astronomical observations

## üîß API Endpoints

- `POST /find-dark-sky-zones`: Get closest zones and viewing recommendations
- `GET /moon-phase/{date}`: Get moon phase for specific date
- `GET /`: API health check

## üî≠ About Dark Sky Zones

Dark sky zones are areas with minimal light pollution where you can observe:
- **Deep sky objects**: Galaxies, nebulae, star clusters
- **Planetary details**: Surface features of planets
- **Meteor showers**: Better visibility of shooting stars
- **Milky Way**: Clear view of our galaxy's structure

The Bortle scale (1-9) measures light pollution levels, with Class 1 being the darkest skies and Class 9 being inner-city conditions.
