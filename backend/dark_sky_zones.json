Nearby cities include Boerne, Kerrville, and Fredericksburg, with smaller communities dispersed throughout. Blanco is neighbored by Travis, Hays, and Comal Counties, some of the fastest growing counties in the nation. As described by the authors of the City's Dark Sky Community application, the \"City of Blanco is located on the edge of darkness.\" Satellite imagery clearly shows that Blanco is situated at the transition zone between suburban and rural development as indicated by the density of artificial lighting seen from above. Despite its rapid growth, the Hill Country is one of the most active regions for dark sky conservation in the U.S. - home to Dripping Springs, Fredericksburg, Horseshoe Bay, and Wimberley Valley International Dark Sky Communities, as well as Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, Milton Reimers Ranch, and Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Park International Dark Sky Parks. Years-long efforts in the Hill Country to combat light pollution demonstrate a heightened awareness of the value of environmental protections in the face of rapid development throughout the region. It also highlights how dark skies bring people together. Continued momentum of the dark sky movement in the Hill Country, culminating in Blanco's Dark Sky Community certification, is the result of hard work and dedication of numerous volunteers with the Blanco County Friends of the Night Sky and the cooperation and support of the City of Blanco County Commissioners Court, the Blanco Chamber of Commerce, the Hill Country Astronomers, the Hill Country Alliance, and the Texas Chapter of DarkSky.",

    "description": "At over 9 million acres, the Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve is currently the world's largest Reserve and protected Dark Sky Place. The Reserve spans from Fort Davis, Texas, to the Rio Grande River at the US/Mexico international border, and includes three protected areas in Mexico - Maderas del Carmen, Ocampo, and Cañón de Santa Elena - making it the world's first bi-national International Dark Sky Reserve. The protected landscape encompasses a vast area of the Chihuahuan Desert characterized by diverse desert habitat and wildlife, complex geology, and a rich human history. Significant cultural and natural resources dot the landscape of the Reserve representing thousands of years of human occupation and lifeways specially adapted to the rugged desert environment. The Reserve's core area is home to the McDonald Observatory, a world-class astronomical observatory and research facility, and the Nature Conservancy's Davis Mountains Preserve, a 33,000-acre area protected for its 'sky island' habitat. The Reserve's periphery includes two existing International Dark Sky Parks - Big Bend National Park and the Big Bend Ranch State Park Complex - and one International Dark Sky Sanctuary - Black Gap Wildlife Management Area. Long-standing partnerships between the McDonald Observatory, the National and State parks, conservation organizations, advocacy groups, and enthusiastic communities focused on environmental conservation have made the Reserve effort possible. These individuals and organizations have spent countless hours updating outdoor lighting ordinances; collecting and compiling sky quality data; inventorying, documenting, improving lighting; and educating the public about the importance of dark sky preservation. These efforts led to the successful development of the Reserve and will continue to ensure night sky preservation in the Big Bend region into the future.",

    "description": "The Municipality of Jelsa is situated in the middle of the island Hvar, Croatia, and covers an area of 121.2 km2. The modern administrative territory of the Municipality of Jelsa was founded in 1993 and consists of 12 settlements: Jelsa, Gdinj, Gromin Dolac, Humac, Ivan Dolac, Pitve, Poljica, Svirče, Vrboska, Vrisnik, Zastražišće, and Zavala. At the 2021 census, the total population of all the settlements in the municipality together was 3,582 inhabitants. The town of Jelsa is situated in a bay in the middle of the Hvar's north coast. There are dense pine woods on the sloping hills of the island's southern ridge, and the agricultural plain lying to the west of Jelsa is the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) world heritage site Starigrad Plain. While Jelsa is the first International Dark Sky Community in Croatia, it is the country's third International Dark Sky Place, after Petrova Gora-Biljeg and Vrani Kamen as International Dark Sky Parks. While the exact period is not well known, extant archaeological materials during the Roman period and a reference in the 1331 Statute of Hvar prove the existence of a settlement in this area for the past several hundred years. The present-day town of Jelsa was later founded as a port for the village of Pitve in the 14th century. From fishing and agriculture, Jelsa developed into a shipbuilding and maritime center, especially during the 19th century. The town prospered and became the administrative capital for the central municipality of the island of Hvar. To protect Jelsa's night sky, the Croatian Astronomical Union conducted a municipal-wide lighting inventory to list all existing public and private lighting. The Municipality of Jelsa then took that information and retrofitted over 1,000 public lights that are fully shielded (ULOR or upward light output ratio = 0), do not emit light above 3,000K CCT (color correlated temperature), and are only used for a necessary task. This major retrofit project has encouraged private stakeholders, such as resorts and cultural monuments, to follow this example and will work to implement quality community-friendly and environmentally-friendly lighting over the next five years. In efforts to engage the community in participating in the dark-sky movement, the Croatian Astronomical Union organized several public events, such as astronomical observations and light pollution lectures, as well as developing school activities educating various age groups on the importance of preserving dark skies.",

It's located in the natural domain of the Atlantic Forest and includes areas of dense ombrophilous forest, seasonal semi-deciduous forest, and high mountain grasslands. PED currently has a flora list containing 1,321 species, of which, 58 are endangered species (Ordinance MMA / 443) and 81 are endemic species of the Rio de Janeiro State. Access to the Park is allowed 24 hours a day. For entry after 5 PM, the visitor needs to sign a \"visiting responsibility term\" at the PED Visitor Center. PED provides incredible sensations of experiences in its different trails, waterfalls, and other attractions for public use. Visitors can also indulge in activities such as climbing, birdwatching, adventure tourism, horseback riding, stargazing, as well as experiencing one's connection with raw nature and deep silence. At night, the main attraction is the brilliant sky with breathtaking views of the stars above. The overall average readings of night sky quality at Desengano State Park is 21.75 magnitudes/ arcsecond 2, indicating that the Milky Way is clearly visible and full of striking light and color. The Dark Sky Park has the total absence of artificial lighting and is located between valleys, hills, and vegetation, which results in a process of total isolation from external lighting. In the months between May and August, the sky is completely clear of cloud interference. The best location to enjoy stargazing experiences will be the Morumbeca dos Marreiros sector. This is the only area that is possible to access the park by motorized vehicles and is also the one that has the best infrastructure for receiving visitors. Visitors aiming to enjoy the dark sky experience will be encouraged to do it through the implementation of the \"Astronomical Program,\" created and developed by Inea, which promotes activities such as stargazing and hiking under the dark sky. Another activity that will be conducted by PED's partner, the Clube de Astronomia Loius Cruls, is the \"Outdoor Planetarium.\" In an open amphitheater, people are invited to identify the planets and the main visible constellations. Green lights and subtitles will be used to help people with the identification of constellations, planets, the moon, and the sun. To show their commitment to protecting the night sky, PED upgraded all 78 light fixtures and removed 3 unnecessary existing lighting fixtures at the visitor center with 2300K amber lamps and fully shielded fixtures by creating and installing coverings made from recycled materials. Additionally, interpretive environmental education activities provide several opportunities to educate visitors on proper lighting retrofits, including watching a video with solutions, monitoring light pollution with SQM-L devices, and comparing the quality of dark sky in areas without light and areas with light (notably the retrofitted lights at the headquarters in Santa Maria Madalena).",

The Seashore is a low, narrow ribbon of sand running from Ocracoke Inlet on the northeast to Beaufort Inlet to the southwest. The barrier islands consist of wide, bare beaches with low dunes covered by scattered grasses, flat grasslands bordered by dense vegetation, and large expanses of salt marsh alongside the sound. Wind, waves, and currents are continually at work reshaping the low-lying islands. In this environment, only the most tenacious plants can survive. Yet, up above, Cape Lookout provides outstanding dark skies with minimal light pollution. Measurements of night sky brightness with the Unihedron Sky Quality Meter reveal that on the barrier islands the zenith brightness is 21.4 magnitudes/arcsecond 2 while the mainland Visitors Center area is 21.2 magnitudes/arcsecond 2 - ideal conditions for viewing the Milky Way with the unaided eye. The Seashore manages a visitors center located at the end of Harkers Island. All areas of the Seashore are open and have public access 24 hours a day. The islands can be accessed by four ferries (one operated by the Seashore) or by private vessel. The visitors center is accessible by the road that runs the length of Harkers Island. Since January 2020, members of the Crystal Coast Stargazers host outreach activities on behalf of Cape Lookout National Seashore to educate the community and stakeholders on the following topics: Additionally, Cape Lookout National Seashore has a YouTube channel that provides videos from presentations and other topics related to preserving night skies. Cape Lookout's other partner, the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and Heritage Center, will be including outreach activities on preserving the night skies during education programs they have throughout the year. Additionally, Core Sound demonstrated its commitment to preserving the night skies above Cape Lookout by replacing its Metal Halide parking lot fixtures with fully-shielded 3000K LED and DarkSky Approved Autobahn ATB2 fixtures, along with timers to turn off the lights four hours after dusk. Each pole has a sign alerting visitors of the timed session to help protect night skies. There are also permanent signs outside of the parking lot and inside the Park that educate visitors on the specifications and reasoning for the lighting retrofit.",

Centuries of farming, mining activities, burial sites, and other placed granite stones shape the landscape. Some of the stones are thought to have astronomical connections. The array of archaeological relics - ranging from Neolithic Quoits (chambered tombs) to standing stones and stone circles from the Early Bronze Age - bear testament to early human settlement. This wild landscape persists with a powerful sense of place due to the absence of 21st-century pressures, inspiring many writers and artists. West Penwith lacks major modern infrastructure and development, and this helps preserve its tranquil and undisturbed distinctive landscape. Cornwall has several sections classified as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), including West Penwith. These locations are designated as exceptional landscapes whose distinctive character and natural beauty are precious enough to be protected and enhanced for nature, people, business, and culture. Due to its remoteness, there is a high level of calm, further enhanced by the rugged coastline, uninterrupted sea views, and dark skies. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England's (CPRE) interactive Night Blight mapping tool, Cornwall has been identified as the fourth darkest \"county\" in their study of England. Unlike National Parks, AONBs are not owners or controllers of the land but work through influence and collaboration. The designation is hence valued and respected by the community and is protected through planning procedures.",

The topography of PNRML is marked by rivers, as 80% of the rivers of the Limousin region come from the Plateau of Millevaches. The effect of water on the territory is historical since the origin of the word \"Millevaches\" could come from the Occitan (regional language) word \"Mille Vaca\", which translates to \"the thousand sources.\" The entire Reserve territory includes 124 municipalities, 9 intercommunalities, and covers three départments with Creuse, Corrèze, and Haute-Vienne, as well as the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. In total, the Reserve covers 3,350 km 2 with 38,950 inhabitants. Indeed, the Milky Way can be observed with the naked eye throughout the Reserve, even in the most populous municipalities such as Meymac (2,322 inhabitants), with an average zenith night sky brightness measurement of 21.6 mag / arcsec2. Visitors are always delighted to see how visible the stars are in the region. Multiple partnerships, management plans, and resources were constructed and obtained to support the Reserve's efforts. For example, the IDSR territory utilizes the program PETR ( Pôle d'Équilibre Territorial et Rural ), which aims to improve cooperation between rural areas and small municipalities. PNRML also has part of the territory treated by a SCOT ( Schéma de Cohérence Territoriale ), which is a framework document for planning towns coherently. Finally, there are four local energy authorities in the Reserve territory. Two in Corrèze (FDEE19 and Diège), one in Creuse (SDEC), and one in Haute-Vienne (SEHV). Their collaboration in the IDSR project is essential to improve the Reserve's lighting in both the core and periphery, as the energy authorities manage and maintain all publicly-owned fixtures. Additionally, these energy authorities help advise municipalities on the luminaires to install, replace, or remove. In search of energy efficiency, PNRML carried out a public lighting renovation project in 2015 in certain municipalities whose political wills converged with the Reserve project. PNRML supported these municipalities by obtaining and supplying funding from the CEE-TEPCV (Energy Saving Certificate - Positive Energy Territory for Green Growth) program. In addition to modernizing public lighting, the project renovated 1,063 individual fixtures, corresponding to an energy savings of 746 MWh / year across PNRML. PNRML also partnered with the International Center of Art and Landscape of the island of Vassivière (CIAP) to organize two artists' residencies associated with the IDSR process. This work aims to raise awareness of the stakes of the night, while working with actors of the territory, attract artists to the Park, enrich an artistic dynamic coming from the territory, and illustrate our nocturnal landscapes or what is inspired by them. By supporting the arts and depicting their culture in diverse mediums, Regional Natural Park of Millevaches in Limousin will ensure that their stories, legends, tradition, and appreciation of the night sky will continue to persist and inspire those who dare to look up.",

Skyglow from the surrounding community is mitigated by tall trees along the boundary of the park on all sides and the structure of Stacy Park Water Reservoir. The Park gates are open 24 hours a day with one weekend per month designated for stargazing activities to encourage night sky viewing. Additionally, Stacy Park partners with the IDA Missouri Chapter, Missouri Master Naturalists, St. Louis Audubon Society, and the St. Louis Astronomical Society to offer programs on preserving the night sky and the detrimental effects of light pollution on wildlife and the environment.",

    "description": "North Ronaldsay is the most northern island of the Orkney archipelago and acts as a staging post for migrating birds to both Scandinavia and the Iceland/Greenland Arctic. Most of the Orkney Islands have some evidence of prehistoric settlements and Viking folklore, which has led to the protection and conservation of the Island's unique breed of short-tailed North Ronaldsay sheep. There is evidence of human habitation in Orkney from over 6,000 years ago, with the Knap of Howar on Papa Westray being the 'oldest dwelling house in the UK'. On Mainland Orkney, the sites of Maeshowe, Ring of Brodgar, and Skara Brae were given World Heritage Status, and the prehistoric stone circles are some of the most visited attractions in Orkney. The islands are internationally renowned for their excellent bird-watching, but the sheer number of birds that the islands support makes it one of the premier all-season British destinations. The Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB) owns, leases, or manages over 8,000 hectares of land in Orkney in the interests of protecting important breeding grounds and conserving habitat. The variety of habitat and the richness of the farmland, heather moorland, and coastal waters provide ideal breeding territory for a host of species, including species such as corncrake, red-throated divers, hen harrier, merlin, peregrine, whimbrel, and pintail. While visitors to North Ronaldsay can tour the North Ronaldsay Bird Observatory, they will also soon be able to interact with the small observatory that will connect night sky enthusiasts to observations of the universe. This learning center will maintain an eight-inch Reflector Telescope and access to the StarLab Planetarium, which will provide viewing opportunities unrestricted by clouds, weather, or time of day. Even though the Island currently supports a small population of 72 residents, the Island recognizes that revitalizing the economy with astrotourism is an essential element in its long-term sustainability.",

The island is part of the UNESCO Wadden Sea World Heritage, which is the largest tidal flat system in the world. In the Wadden Sea, the life of animals and plants is dominated by the tides, and thus by the courses of the sun and the moon. In most regions of the Wadden Sea, there is hardly any artificial light and the night is still so dark that it is governed by the moonlight. From satellite imagery and ground-based sky brightness measurements, Spiekeroog is identified as one of the darkest places in Germany with sky brightness values as high as 22 mag/arcsec2. The reduction of light emissions in the Wadden Sea area was formulated in the cross-border initiative of the Leeuwarden Declaration of 2018, signed by the Ministers of the Environment of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. Here, Dutch and German partners in the Frisian Wadden Sea area are working together to develop and implement environmentally friendly and sustainable tourism to preserve and protect the Wadden Sea ecosystem. As a Star Island, Spiekeroog can become a best practice example for other communities in the region by demonstrating how emissions of unnecessary light can be reduced and securing a place where humans and nature sustainably coexist.",

The Wadden Sea is one of the last remaining large-scale, intertidal ecosystems where natural processes continue to function largely undisturbed. With 10 to 12 million birds living or resting in the Wadden Sea every year, the National Park around Pellworm belongs to one of the most important sites for coastal birds in the world. Pellworm is an important resting area for protected brent and barnacle geese on their migration between their breeding grounds in Siberia and their winter habitats in the south of Europe. As an almost predator-free island, Pellworm is also a hotspot for oystercatchers and other wading birds that have become rare on the mainland. By reducing unnecessary artificial light, Pellworm is directly supporting bird migration as well as improving the habitat quality for birds on the island. The landscape around Pellworm itself used to be an extensive lowland area of bogs and marshes that was first settled by Frisians in the 11th century. Archeological remains of the settlements washed away by storm surges throughout the past millennium can still be found in the tidal flats today. In the modern era, Pellworm is well known for offering a unique holiday experience with many interactions with the local population. In order to strengthen the tourist sector, the island aims at increasing overnight stays in a sustainable way by incorporating astrotourism into its economy. Pellworm also belongs to the district (Landkreis) Nordfriesland, which according to the publication \" Light Pollution in USA and Europe: The good, the bad and the ugly \" (Falchi et al., 2019) belongs to the Top 25 (rank 13) administrative units with least light emission in Europe.",

In that time, the percentage of area consumed by urban land use has multiplied from 6% to over 35%. Today, the Forest Preserves manages lands that preserve some of the best examples of Illinois' natural and cultural heritage. These lands harbor remarkable plant and animal diversity and offer urban and suburban residents and visitors opportunities to explore nature, recreate, as well as a chance experience solitude and quiet. Each year the Preserves receive an estimated 62 million visits, a testament to how closely intertwined people are with nature. The District is also an area in the northeastern region of Illinois that currently has some of the best views of the night sky, with average values of 18.31 magnitudes / arcsecond2 - a 1.5 magnitude improvement over night sky readings within the city of Chicago. The area within the Palos Preserves, historically referred to as Mt. Forest Island, is a 6,662 acre (26.96 km2) area of the Cook County Forest Preserves just 24km from downtown Chicago. The Forest Preserves- and particularly the Palos Preserves - have become a local natural laboratory for our real-world connection to the night. The certification of this Urban Night Sky Place will also be instrumental in providing an opportunity to promote the resource of the nighttime environment to those who need it most.

The fossils owe their incredible preservation state to the interaction of from the nearby Thirtynine Mile volcanic field with the biology of the lake. Volcanic ash falling on the lake caused a 'diatom bloom' that rapidly filled the lake basin with fine ash layers alternating with clays and muds. These deposits form so-called \"paper shales\" that preserved even delicate details of plants and animals. Fossil collecting began in the late 19th century and resulted in the removal of important paleontological specimens. Today the Park is the site of ongoing paleontology research while accommodating some 60,000 visitors a year.

Its focal point is Zion Canyon, a steep-walled gorge carved through hundreds of meters of early Jurassic-era Navajo sandstone by the North Fork of the Virgin River. Due to its location near the junction of three great geographic provinces of the American West (the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert), the Park protects a remarkable diversity of plant and animal species inhabiting several different life zones. Zion National Park is the ancestral homelands of many indigenous tribes including the Paiute, Ute, Goshute, Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, and Pueblo tribes. The significance of the land to indigenous people and their history in the area is demonstrated through a rich tradition of oral history and knowledge passed between generations. Today, tribal nations remain deeply connected to the land, as they have since time immemorial. Indigenous people refer to the canyon formed by the North Fork of the Virgin River by several names. The Virgin River and its tributaries, as well as the wildlife and plants, are sacred. Zion National Park strives to learn from and collaborate with our tribal partners as we seek to co-steward this special place. Zion's archeological record provides evidence of at least 8,000 years of human occupation by indigenous people and European settlers. Scientific surveys in the park have identified sites and artifacts attributed to the Archaic Adaptive Strategy, Basketmaker, Puebloan or Formative time period, Post-Puebloan time period, and European settlement. Today, as one of the \"Big Five\" national parks in southern Utah, Zion is famous for its many hiking trails and activities, including camping, horseback riding, nature walks, and rock climbing. Nighttime programming has been a staple at the Park for many years, the area's dark night skies attracting visitors from around the world.

These former inhabitants also carved and painted thousands of intricate images on the canyon walls. Many of these panels portray celestial bodies and appear to record Fremont's seasonal interactions with astronomical phenomena. Since its founding, the park has hosted astronomical events such as star parties, \"Astrofests,\" and archaeoastronomical observances.

The collection also includes the holotype specimens of \"Ferrodraco\", a flying reptile and \"Confractosuchus\", a prehistoric crocodile. Visitors can experience the Museum through guided tours of its Fossil Preparation Laboratory, Reception Center and Dinosaur Canyon, home to life-sized bronze dinosaur dioramas. The \"March of the Titanosaurs\" exhibition showcases the 54-metre-long Snake Creek track site, Australia's best-preserved sauropod track way, while the Gondwana Stars Observatory links Earth's prehistoric past to the vast cosmos above. As a leader in conservation and education, the Museum preserves its 14km2 site through the Dinosaurs to Dunnarts citizen science program, which has been running since 2009.

AD 675-754), best known for his missionary work to the Germanic parts of the Frankish Empire in the eighth century, Fulda remains an important German bishopric. While best known as a place of Christian pilgrimage in the Medieval period, Fulda's thriving modern economy based on small to medium-sized manufacturing companies has yielded one of the lowest unemployment rates of any region within a European Union member state. Located near the western edge of the Rhön International Dark Sky Reserve, Fulda (population~68,000) is the most significant source of artificial light at night near the Reserve's boundary. As a result, discussions with the City began shortly after the Rhön designation in 2014 concerning its future status with respect to controlling its outdoor lighting for the benefit of preserving conditions in the Reserve. The intent was to create a symbiosis between the City and the Reserve, as ecotourism became an increasingly important component of the region's economic mix. Following the example of the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, the City has secured IDA recognition in its own right.

The Preserve is also a dark nighttime refuge for wildlife in the midst of significant skyglow from nearby cities such as Urbana, Champaign and Rantoul. Concern for the area's night skies began in 2007 when members of the Champaign-Urbana Astronomical Society (CUAS) lobbied for changes to street lighting in the jurisdiction of Champaign, the largest municipality in Champaign County. In the same year, CUAS began collaborating with the District's Education Department to offer 'Starwatch' astronomy-related stargazing programs at the Preserve. In 2016-17, the District spent over $20,000 to upgrade the Preserve's outdoor lighting to meet IDA recommendations, and new interpretive programs educate the public about the benefits of nighttime darkness and interpret the lighting retrofit project to Preserve visitors. The new programs also provide an opportunity to showcase the new dark-sky-compliant light fixtures installed at Middle Fork and offer suggestions to the public on how to limit excessive nighttime light in their home environments. The importance and benefits of darkness and a star-filled sky now play a role in all of of the Preserve's nighttime programs.",

    "description": "Cévennes National Park (Parc National des Cévennes in French) is a 2,973-square-kilometer national park situated mainly in the sparsely populated French départements of Lozère, Gard, Ardèche, and Aveyron. The region is located in the southeastern extreme of the Massif Central, a highland region of mountains and plateaus in the middle of southern France. The land rises above the plains of the Languedoc region and slopes gradually toward the Mediterranean Sea in a series of plains alternating with a maze of deep river valleys. The park includes several mountains and high plateau including Mont Lozère, Mont Aigoual, and the Causse Méjean. Occupied by humans for at least the last 400,000 years, Cévennes is best known as the heart of the Camisard revolt of the early eighteenth century, in which French Calvinist Protestants rose up against religious persecutions following the Edict of Fontainebleau, issued by King Louis XIV in 1685. Despite its rebellious past, today Cévennes is the peaceful home of over 71,000 inhabitants living in 250 villages within its borders. They operate over 400 farms whose lands comprise one quarter of the park's territory. It is, as National Geographic puts it, \"not a pure wilderness park but a classic landscape of traditional French life.\" The park offers a diversity of outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain biking, fishing, kayaking, and spelunking. The rugged landscape and traditionally difficult life of the typical cévenol throughout history has largely kept development at bay, and the park remains one of the darker spots in southern France. Visitors to the region increasingly come to view the night sky, largely unspoiled by skyglow as in the more densely populated regions of the country. The park authority has done a commendable job in developing this resource carefully for the benefit of both public outreach as well as sustainable tourism.",

Its name refers to the presence of many well-preserved trunks of trees that grew in a humid and subtropical forest near the edge of the supercontinent Pangaea during the Late Triassic period of the Mesozoic era, about 225 million years ago. Downed trees were quickly covered by sediment washing out of mountains in the continent's interior, creating anoxic conditions that promoted fossilization among alternating layers of mudstone, silt- stone, and claystone. Because the colorful, mineralized interiors of the trunks are highly valued when cut and polished, protection of the site from destructive fossil hunting became a priority in the early twentieth century, leading to its establishment first as a U.S. National Monument in 1906 and a National Park in 1962. In addition to preserving its geological resources, the Park also boasts many kilometers of trails for hiking and mountain biking, and visitors enjoy other activities such as photography and wildlife viewing. Given its location in a rural area of Arizona, and that roughly half of its territory is designated wilderness, Petrified Forest is increasingly recognized as a valuable reservoir of nighttime darkness. In the last decade, the Park began offering nighttime programming highlighting the value of the night sky to wildlife and other natural resources; more recently, outreach has directly addressed the issue of light pollution and external impacts to the Park's night skies. Further, the Park has begun to remedy problematic outdoor lighting in order to better serve as an example of proper lighting practices. Designation as an International Dark Sky Park not only recognizes the Park's efforts to protect its nighttime resources, but complements the value of other International Dark Sky Places in northern Arizona that keep pressure on governments from the municipal to state levels in pursuing policies that promote preservation of dark night skies across the region.",

A temporary outpost of the U.S. Army was established at West Clear Creek shortly thereafter, which became Camp Verde in 1865 and Fort Verde in 1871 and was occupied until 1891. For thousands of years before the nineteenth century, the Verde Valley was home to a succession of prehistoric cultures, and the area still hosts a population of members of the Yavapai-Apache Nation. Inspired by the successes of nearby Flagstaff and Sedona, Camp Verde began work toward International Dark Sky Community (IDSC) status in mid-2014. The effort was slow-going, on account of a need to convince an initially skeptical resident base of the need for a significant overhaul of the town's outdoor lighting policy. The changes to enable IDSC eligibility became effective in March 2018.

Mission San José de Tumacácori and Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi were established in 1691 by Father Eusebio Kino (1645-1711), a Jesuit priest. The third mission protected by the park, Mission San Cayetano de Calabazas, was established nearby in 1756. According to the park website, Tumacácori \" sits at a cultural crossroads in the Santa Cruz River valley. Here O'odham, Yaqui, and Apache people met and mingled with European Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries, settlers, and soldiers, sometimes in conflict and sometimes in cooperation. \" After experiencing a decline in the early nineteenth century and in significant disrepair, the missions were abandoned by 1848. It is an important site in the history of the Spanish colonization of what is now the southwestern United States. Since 2016, the Park has conducted a number of evening programs intended to draw visitors' attention to the night sky over Tumacácori in the context of natural darkness as a cultural resource. This is similar to the interpretive strategy at Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which became an IDA International Dark Sky Park in 2013. In addition to expanding the palette of visitor offerings at a Park whose focus is not on natural resources, the staff at Tumacácori use night skies as a means of conveying a sense of what the Southwest was like in the time when the first Spanish missionaries arrived in the seventeenth century.

The land is formally under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Reit im Winkl, whose eastern edge reaches the international border with Austria. Its name derives in part from the German word for a seasonal mountain pasture ( Alm ), referring to transhumance, the movement of people and their livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures practiced in the Alps for thousands of years. Alms have become important for reasons other than transhumance, protecting large areas of unforested land useful for avalanche control and providing habitat for various endangered species of alpine flora. Its location and geographic setting also make the Winklmoosalm a remarkably dark place at night, despite the relatively short distance to Salzburg, Austria (40 km; population 150,000). Unobstructed, 360-degree views reveal a night sky largely unspoiled by light pollution where a full array of faint phenomena can be seen. Interest in stargazing at the site began over a decade ago, and has grown into an industry served by a small tourism infrastructure.

    "description": "Rainbow Bridge National Monument is a 65-hectare (160 acre) site in the U.S. state of Utah that preserves one of the tallest and longest natural bridges in the world. The bridge was created by Bridge Creek during the last glacial period, during which it encountered layers of sandstone of different durability deposited in the area during an extended arid period during the Triassic and Jurassic geologic eras. The water diverted around what became the bridge after eroding away softer rocks from the harder sandstone beneath them. Continuous washing of the creek water, containing abrasive quartz grains, against each side of the turn eventually eroded a continuous passage through its center. The bridge, of cultural importance to a number of area Native American tribes, has been designated a Traditional Cultural Property by the U.S. National Park Service. Evidence of human habitation in the area extends back at least a thousand years; the modern Pauite and Navajo people came to call the structure Nonnezoshe or \"rainbow turned to stone.\" Nearby inhabitants continue to revere the bridge as a sacred place. Due to its extremely remote location in difficult terrain, the existence of the bridge was not known to European-Americans until 1909. Its remote setting has also kept Rainbow Bridge well away from later European settlement; to this day, it is only accessible via a two-hour boat ride on Lake Powell from marinas near Page, Arizona, followed by a mile-long hike, or by hiking overland for several days from a trailhead on the south side of Lake Powell. As a result, the site remains naturally dark; the U.S. National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division estimates that artificial light at the zenith is less than five percent above the natural background level. Given the Monument's protected status and isolated location, and taking into account its essentially pristine night skies, it is especially appropriate to the International Dark Sky Sanctuary label.",

The Park consists of land distributed over several constituent islands, certain stretches of open water, and adjacent coastal areas. It is the southernmost national park in Japan, in its southernmost prefecture, and preserves the only tropical rainforest in the country. In addition to large mangrove communities at the mouths of broad rivers, the islands are ringed by living coral reefs. The Park provides refuge for a number of threatened plant and animal species, and Iriomote Island is home to the critically endangered Iriomote cat ( Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis ), discovered only fifty years ago. The Park also represents an unusual set of circumstances for the preservation and promotion of dark skies. The Yaeyama Islands support a permanent population of about 54,000 people settled in and among the Park's territory. They are governed by two municipalities, Ishigaki City and Taketomi Town, who along with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment are responsible for the administration of the Park. The population is heavily concentrated into Ishigaki City on Ishigaki Island, which serves as Yaeyama's sea port, airport, and main commercial hub.

As a result, the region is still remarkably dark at night, and this darkness is an attractive quality to many of the residents who now call places like Ketchum home. In turn, the City has responded to concerns about light pollution in order to help preserve the existing quality of life. Its first comprehensive outdoor lighting ordinance was enacted in 1999, and the code was recently updated to meet IDA International Dark Sky Community standards. The City has reached out to residents to educate them about the need for dark skies, committed to bringing all of its municipally-owned lighting into compliance with the code, and has contributed to the ongoing effort to designate the United States' first International Dark Sky Reserve in the adjacent Sawtooth National Forest.",

    "description": "Ramon Crater (Hebrew: מכתש רמון, Makhtesh Ramon; hereafter the \"Crater\" ) is an 1,100-square- kilometer nature reserve in the Negev Desert of southern Israel. The Crater was formed by neither meteor impact nor volcanic activity; rather, it is an example of a makhtesh, a landform considered unique to the Negev and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Geologic uplift in both regions produced stresses on soft rock types such as chalk and sandstone, which in the region are overlaid by more durable layers of dolomite and limestone. Erosion of the softer layers along northeast-southwest ridges in the Negev caused the harder upper layers to collapse, resulting in deep, closed valleys known as erosion cirques. Ramon Crater is the largest of these features in the Negev, appearing as a gash on the landscape some 40 kilometers long, 2 to 10 kilometers wide and up to 500 meters deep. Some 300,000 visitors a year are drawn to its remote location for hiking, off-road touring, cycling, horseback riding, camping and other outdoor activities. The harsh climate and forbidding landscape of the Negev has largely repelled historical attempts to settle the land after it became part of an independent Israel in 1948. As a result, its night skies are considerably darker on average than in the northern, more heavily-populated areas of the country. Coupled with typically good weather and a dry climate, the Negev increasingly draws stargazers from across the Middle East and Europe. The situation of Ramon Crater within this environment offers a substantial degree of long-term protection for its night skies. The management of the site has added offerings of nighttime interpretive programs and stargazing opportunities, and has lately reached out to neighboring communities and organizations to partner with them in activities intended to help preserve the Crater's dark skies and promote astrotourism for regional economic development.",

    "description": "Kartchner Caverns State Park is located in southeastern Arizona, 14 km (9 miles) south of the town of Benson and west of the north-flowing San Pedro River in the foothills of the Whetstone Mountains. The Park preserves a set of 'living' limestone caverns whose known passages total 3.9 km (2.4 miles). The caverns, discovered on private land in 1974, were once a carefully-guarded secret among cavers who protected the site by limiting knowledge of their existence while lobbying the landowners and the State of Arizona to arrange the sale of the site and the establishment of a state park there. The goal was realized in 1988 with the sale and the Park's founding. Careful management of the caverns, including a complex system of air-lock doors, misting machines and other equipment, are required to properly conserve the delicate interior conditions that allow the cave to continue growing as it has for at least the last 50,000 years, while allowing for public visitation of its chambers. The park also includes several kilometers of hiking trails outside the caverns for public use. Beginning in 2010, the Park management and staff realized that Kartchner's situation in rural Cochise County and accessible facilities made for a good venue for local volunteers with the Huachuca Astronomy Club to conduct nighttime astronomy programs for Park visitors. Since then, the Park has hosted several such events per year and is increasingly known across the region among amateur astronomers, who bring their telescopes to enjoy access to Silver-tier dark skies. The Park has also achieved a remarkable 99% initial compliance with its Lightscape Management Plan, itself the result of Park-led efforts to substantially improve outdoor lighting codes at the county level and in the nearby city of Sierra Vista. Kartchner has successfully raised awareness of dark skies across southeastern Arizona in ways that will help protect the integrity of its own nighttime conditions.",

Repeated lava flows raised the land elevation enough to expose it to prevailing southwesterly winds, helping to keep the area dry. As a result, there is very little vegetation on the lava fields, giving the area the sense of desolation. Upon signing his executive order creating the Monument in 1924, U.S. President Calvin Coolidge succinctly described it : \" this area contains many curious and unusual phenomena of great educational value and has a weird and scenic landscape peculiar to itself.\" The Monument sits at the edge of one of the largest remaining 'pools' of natural nighttime darkness in the lower 48 U.S. states, defined by the rugged wilderness of interior Idaho. Forbidding conditions on the Snake River Plain deterred settlers in historic times, and the area remains sparsely populated. This also serves as a form of natural defense against development that could bring significant new sources of artificial light at night; most larger cities in Idaho roughly follow the course of the Snake River as it sweeps a wide arc through the southern half of the state. Craters Of The Moon has capitalized its dark-sky resource - as well as its planetary-themed name - to draw visitor attention to the splendor of its night skies and their active conservation.",

With respect to dark skies, the Park is in a virtually unique setting sandwiched between the \"Inland Empire\" metropolitan area of some 4 million inhabitants near its western edge, and the last pool of natural darkness remaining in Southern California in its eastern extremity. For residents of the greater Los Angeles area - some 18 million people as of 2015 - Joshua Tree National Park is the nearest convenient place to go stargazing under a relatively dark sky. While the western half of the Park is significant impacted by light from Palm Springs and, to a lesser extent, the cities of the nearby Morongo Basin, visitors who make the trek to the Park's eastern wilderness area are rewarded with some of the darkest night skies left in the region. With the rise of an astrotourism base, the Park has taken an increasingly active role in preserving what darkness remains. Its own house is in good order, the result of a lack of utility-provided electricity within the Park boundaries to power outdoor lighting and a reliance on solar photovoltaic systems. It has made some headway in influencing neighboring jurisdictions, including pressing successfully for major improvements to the lighting ordinance in surrounding San Bernardino County. The Park has also supported efforts to update lighting codes in the cities of Twentynine Palms and Yucca Valley, and it convinced a nearby military base to substantially reduce its use of outdoor light at night. The Park maintains a program of education and outreach to its visitors, impressing on them both the value of natural darkness and the ways that careless use of artificial light at night harms the nighttime environment.",

With little development pressure and nearly 60% of its territory under the management of the New Zealand Department of Conservation as a nature reserve, GBI has retained essentially all of its natural nighttime darkness. Those conditions are protected by the Island's separation from the mainland by the Hauraki Gulf and the absence of utility electricity to power outdoor lighting. A typically dark night sky has become part of the cultural values of Islanders, as they gradually become aware of the potential astrotourism value of maintaining the integrity of the Island's largely pristine nightscapes.

It is an instance in which the demands of real security are balanced against the desire for dark-sky preservation, and a dark nighttime environment satisfies the concerns that usually result in dusk-to-dawn lighting in low-traffic areas. Although the Park is within the outer light dome of the Albuquerque metropolitan area, its Silver-tier skies are an increasing draw for visitors who hear in interpretive programs about how the current night sky differs from what the natives saw before the Spanish conquest. The applicants have reached out beyond their boundaries to educate locals in this sparsely-populated part of the American southwest about the need to protect what natural darkness still remains at Salinas Pueblo.",

Along with Bryce Canyon National Park, 300 kilometers (185 miles) to the southwest, Goblin Valley has some of the highest densities of hoodoos anywhere in the world. The Park's location in a remote corner of the Colorado Plateau and away from major urban centers yields a dark-sky resource that is comparable in quality to several Gold-tier IDA Dark Sky Parks in the region, such as Natural Bridges National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, and Canyonlands National Park. Goblin Valley attracts far fewer visitors than its higher-profile neighbors, but those who choose to visit this out-of-the-way gem are rewarded with nighttime views of the same spectacular skies and much smaller crowds. Park leadership and staff have committed to preserving the quality of local night skies and have developed a modest but effective outreach program that draws visitor attention to the fact that \"half the park is after dark\".",

From the rim, visitors have unobstructed, panoramic views of the volcanic field, distant snow-capped mountains, and portions of four states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado). The Park is situated in one of the darker locations in the lower 48 U.S. states, and as a result it presents night skies that are nearly pristine under typical conditions. The surrounding topography is extremely irregular, consisting of approximately 120 volcanoes and numerous mesas and buttes that rise as high as 600 m above the surrounding plains and stretch from 2 to 22 km. These landforms not only discourage development, but serve as natural screens for distant sources of light on the horizon. Park staff are increasingly knowledgeable about the value of the dark-sky resource there, and present larger numbers of night skies interpretive programs with each passing year. Outreach efforts are underway to communicate the value of dark night skies to residents of sparsely-populated nearby communities.",

In addition to its spectacular daytime vistas of the Warrumbungle Mountain Range, the Park has long been known for the quality of its dark night skies. In the 1950s, seeking relief from the light pollution of Canberra that negatively impacted its Mount Stromlo Observatory, the Australian government relocated major operations to a new observatory at Siding Spring. Now operated by the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the Australian National University, Siding Spring Observatory is home to the 4-meter Anglo-Australian Telescope, the largest in Australia. Lessons learned at Mount Stromlo encouraged early conservation of dark skies in the area, including at Warrumbungle, to protect the national investment in Australia's professional astronomy infrastructure. Warrumbungle's status as the first IDA Dark Sky Park in Australia is a natural extension of the work it has done for years to contain threats to the observatory site through outdoor lighting policy and regional planning. The National Park has increased opportunities for all visitors to take in remarkably dark night skies, whether or not they visit the observatory.",

The canyon is an enormous natural structure standing up to 29 kilometers (18 miles) wide and almost 2 kilometers (1 mile) in depth. Given the Grand Canyon's remarkably dark night skies and U.S. National Park Service (NPS) efforts to make visitors aware that \" half the park is after dark \", an authentic and meaningful dark-skies experience is available to over 6 million visitors annually. The Park is situated in some of the most remote and rugged territory left in the lower 48 U.S. states; this landscape thwarted most historical attempts at development and has left the Canyon's surroundings largely unpopulated. However, its historically high rate of visitation left a legacy of over 5,000 light fixtures in the Park. 2016 the park was awarded Provisional International Dark Sky Park status and the NPS and the Grand Canyon Association embarked on a multi-year effort to bring all of those fixtures into compliance with IDA requirements.

Its name derives from the park lands' use as a natural corral by cowboys in the nineteenth century. At an elevation of 1,800 meters (5,900 feet) above sea level, its dry, high desert climate makes for challenging conditions for the survival of local flora and fauna. In addition to several overlooks, the park features a visitor center, two campgrounds with 56 individual campsites, nine yurts available to rent, one group campsite, a picnic area, and a 14-kilometer (9-mile) loop hiking trail. The park area is best known for its use in the iconic final 'Grand Canyon' scene of the 1991 film Thelma & Louise. The park's situation on the relatively undeveloped Colorado Plateau, and over 48 km (30 mi.) from Moab - the nearest populated place of any consequence - renders it almost as dark as Canyonlands International Dark Sky Park. Furthermore, its position above the canyon walls makes for spectacular, virtually unobstructed, viewing of the night sky with sweeping, 360-degree panoramas. Building on the success at Canyonlands, the park has partnered with the U.S. National Park Service to host evening dark-skies programming for visitors.

    "description": "The Elan Valley of central Wales was purchased by the Birmingham Corporation in 1892 for the purpose of creating a reliable municipal water source for the city of Birmingham, England, some 115 kilometers away. Prior to the construction of dams in the Valley to store a reliable supply of clean water for Birmingham, the city suffered from poor water quality and a lack of sanitation. The Valley's reservoirs still supply drinking water to the region, but in recent years the area has become a popular destination for tourists. Its situation along the mountainous \"spine\" of Wales places it roughly midway between the IDA International Dark Sky Reserve at Brecon Beacons National Park in the south and Snowdonia National Park, an aspiring IDA International Dark Sky Park, in the north. The management of the property was transferred to Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water, a non-profit organization, under terms of the Water Act of 1973. In 1989 Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water established the Elan Valley Trust to ensure the long-term conservation of natural resources in the Valley and to promote both public access to the land and environmental education. Having become aware of the significance of the Valley's dark skies and importance of preserving them, the Trust has taken steps to secure the sky quality with a quality lighting plan and raise awareness of the Valley's dark, fragile nighttime environment.",

Beverly Shores residents have demonstrated their commitment to controlling the growth of outdoor lighting in their town through a series of retrofits and replacements of residential and commercial light fixtures.",

John Observatory, but also conserve energy, protect wildlife, and make the area a popular stargazing destination for tourists. The natural night has played a critical role in the area's history as its first residents, the Māori, not only used the night sky to navigate to the island but also integrated astronomy and star lore into their culture and daily lives. The reserve seeks to honor that history by keeping the night sky a protected and integral part of the area's natural and cultural landscape. It's a perfect place to protect and honor those traditions as the reserve's Mackenzie Basin has the clearest, darkest and the most spectacular night sky in New Zealand.",

As a result, the reserve's 34 municipalities developed outdoor lighting regulations that have contributed to the control and limited growth of area light pollution, which had doubled during the preceding 20 years. Approximately 2,500 light fixtures were replaced, resulting in a 25 percent reduction of area light pollution and a reduction in energy consumption of some 1.3 gigawatt-hours per year.
